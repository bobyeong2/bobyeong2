### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there  I'm a (Junior) back-end developer using Python.
To become a senior back-end developer in the long run, I will upload my learning content to GitHub.

Currently, my knowledge is mainly uploaded about Python-Web Framework, 
but in the future, I want to learn important content from developers such as DataBase, 
API design, TDD, CI/CD, and record my growth as a developer.


ðŸŒ± Skills
